QuickClean.py
=============

A quick and effective way to nuke-clean those folders that get really cluttered really fast (ahem, I'm looking at you /Downloads!)
Preferably used in cohesion with a cron job script or task scheduler at intervals of your convenience (http://www.generateit.net/cron-job/)

When run, this tool moves sorts all your music, pictures, videos, and documents into the folders you instruct them to go to.

***Usage:*** 
$$python QuickClean.py -s <path to directory to be cleaned> -m <music directory> -p <pictures directory> -v <pictures directory>
                                                                                                                -d <documents directory>
